                                    An Australian qualification will make you very attractive to potential employers in
                                    Australia, at home and around the world. Many Australian degrees and vocational
                                    courses include work experience programs and internships so you can gain hands-on
                                    industry experience and grow your professional network while you study.
                                    As a remote yet highly developed country, Australia has captivated us with its
                                    unique natural wonders and exotic wildlife. Australia is one of the few countries
                                    where no matter your travel taste, budget, or age, it can deliver a travel
                                    experience that can't be found anywhere else.

                                    In terms of wealth, education, health, and quality of life, it is ranked as one of
                                    the best countries. Australia has top-ranked institutions, globally recognized
                                    qualifications, and an abundance of scholarships when it comes to education

                                    Why study in Australia? This question brings with it a number of benefits of
                                    studying in Australia for not just domestic students but for international students
                                    as well.
                                </p>

                                    <li>The cost of pursuing education and living in Australia is 40 to 60 per cent less
                                        than that of the USA/UK, varying with the preferred location.</li>
                                    <li>It is the next "hot" destination after the USA considering the numbers, quality
                                        and living conditions. Over a thousand Indian students and students from all
                                        over the world go to Australia to study every year.</li>
                                    <li>Another key benefit of studying in Australia is its globally recognised
                                        Universities which offer a wide variety of courses with up-to-date curricula and
                                        infrastructure while the faculty is result-oriented.</li>
                                    <li>There are part-time job options for international students to gain work
                                        experience and work while studying. This helps in making new connections at the
                                        base level and also helps in networking at a higher stage.</li>
                                    <li>Australia is always open to hiring students who graduate from their universities
                                        because they are trained to be work-ready and hence, job opportunities are
                                        available widely in public and private spheres.</li>

                                            across the globe and international students are not bound to work in

                                            Australia’s population is on the rise, reporting a more than positive
                                            incline in its trend. As such, there is a strong demand for quality
                                            education and in turn of quality educationists. This is more prevalent for
                                            primary teachers and language teachers. The industry expects to see a
                                            double-digit growth by 2025 (as per official reports).
                                            So, if teaching excites you, then you are sure to find a relevant job in
                                            Australia. The qualifications would ideally include specialists in primary
                                            teaching and training as well as specialist counselors. Accordingly, the hot
                                            courses would include a Masters in Education. Also, most of the TAFE
                                            Institutes offer excellent certificate programs that can facilitate the

                                            While Australia is looking at a baby boom, it also suffers from an aging
                                            population like most of the developed countries. With more people crossing

                                            technologies, the demand for healthcare and medical professionals is on the
                                            rise. Expected forecasts of the industry for 2020 and beyond look very
                                            positive. The same forecasts also suggest a shortfall of more than 100,000
                                            nurses in Australia by the year 2050.

                                            are very expensive and run for about 5 years. You can plan your studies in
                                            Australia and start by learning all about Medicine from Australia –

                                            requires more skilled workers. The demand for plumbers, electricians, and
